# pacman-ai-agent-
A practice of breadth-first algorithms ( Dijkstra algorithms) 
## Introduciton
In this project, I will build a AI agent using Dikjstra algorithms to play play Pac-Man game and try to achieve the highest score.

## Implementation
The code for Pac-Man was adapted from the open-source made available by [Mike Billars](https://sites.google.com/site/doctormike/pacman.html) and the original version can be installed as a standard package in [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/games/pacman4console).

### How Pac-Man game works
For the explaination, see [Pacman Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man)
